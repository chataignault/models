# Networks based on path development 

Extension of my MSc thesis on 'Harmonic Analysis for measures on the space of paths'.

The idea is to use the embedding from a path to a matrix Lie group as a representation to characterise a measure.

Depending on the Lie group, different properties can be expected, for instance SO is compact and looses many degrees of freedom, while GL is the most general one.

One of the objectives is to observe that regularisation on the embedding parameters can force the model to discover a useful representation from a large embedding.

The base implementation for path developments can be found here :


### Installation note 
- Underlying package are taylored for an old python and torch version that is not supported by aeon 
- Forked package containes extra Lie groups and resolved pyhon libraries / working installer
