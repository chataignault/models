# Probabilitic PCA on MNIST dataset

A simple idea to generative modelling, as mentionned in 
*Bengio, Yoshua, Ian Goodfellow, and Aaron Courville. Deep learning. Vol. 1. Cambridge, MA, USA: MIT press, 2017.* 
is to consider the PCA on some dataset, and to add noise to the decomposed matrix
to generate samples that were not in the training set, 
but that share the same principal components with their respective ampliture.
