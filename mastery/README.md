# Non-Commutative Fourier Transform of functions or measures on paths.

Signature methods define transforms from sequential data
to an aggregate of statistics (which is not sequential anymore).

Key valuable properties include naturally handling missing data in sequences, 
and sequences with different sampling frequencies.

Measures on paths can be thought of as either 
the underlying distribution of time-series datasets,
or the flow of a stochastic differential equation.

Combining harmonic analysis tools with the signature transform,
and geometric deep learning for the implementation,
the objective is to characterise measures on paths 
with a set of parameterized statistics,
which can have applications in 
statistical hypothesis testing,
and time-series classification.

\begin{cases}
dZ_t =  Z_t M_{\theta} (dx_t) \\
Z_0 = I
\end{cases}
