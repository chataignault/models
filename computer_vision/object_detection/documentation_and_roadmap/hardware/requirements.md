# Embedded system hardware specification

The following includes contraints about the design of an embedded system.
Your task is to write a full specification, making specific hardware choices,
justifyin

## Component requirements

**camera** 
- 20-30 degree angle of vision
- max 32 mm diameter
- commercially available
- 45 to 80 frames per second
- commercially available

**processing board**
- handles image processing 
- communicates with the flight controller
- max 30 mm diameter
- max 55 mm in length
- commercially available 

**flight controller**
> Out of scope
- must send direction information to the embedded system in real time

## Overall constraints
- The total budget should be 500 dollars.
    - The cheaper the viable solution, the better.
- Items should be commercially available
- Prefer items origin from : Europe first, then America, then Other

## Guidelines

Proceed item by item, browse the internet to find actual hardware items that are commercially available.
You make quote multiple viable items for each components.
Make sure the items are compatible with each other.

## Expected output
A formatted `.md` document with clearly defined sections :
- a section with the main relevant items for each component
    - justify each choice with care, from the specs of the item, from the vendor or on internet
- a section including the best combinations of the aforementionned items.
- conclude with the best selection, justify the choice according to the **Component Requirements** and **Overall constraints**
