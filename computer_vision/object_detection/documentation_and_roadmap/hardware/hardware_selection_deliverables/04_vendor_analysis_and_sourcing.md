   - Maintain relationships with 2-3 suppliers per category

2. **Geographic Concentration Risk**
   - Mitigation: Balance Asian manufacturers with European distributors
   - Consider supply chain disruption scenarios

3. **Technology Obsolescence**
   - Mitigation: Select vendors with clear product roadmaps
   - Avoid components near end-of-life

4. **Price Volatility**  
   - Mitigation: Establish pricing agreements for volumes
   - Budget 10-15% contingency for price fluctuations

## Vendor Relationship Development

### Immediate Actions (Week 1-2)
1. Contact e-con Systems for camera module quotation
2. Verify Portwell MicroSOM availability and pricing
3. Establish accounts with RS Components and Farnell
4. Request NVIDIA development kit from distributor

### Medium-term Strategy (Month 1-3)
1. Evaluate vendor technical support quality
2. Negotiate volume pricing for production quantities
3. Establish backup supplier relationships
4. Document vendor qualification process

### Long-term Partnership (3+ months)
1. Regular business reviews with key suppliers
2. Early access to new product developments
3. Supply chain risk management programs
4. Joint development opportunities for custom solutions

## Conclusion and Vendor Recommendations

**Primary Vendor Strategy:**
- **Camera**: e-con Systems (direct) with Arducam (EBV Elektronik) as backup
- **Processing**: NVIDIA (RS Components/Arrow) as primary platform
- **Components**: RS Components for integration parts and mechanical
- **Development Support**: Leverage NVIDIA ecosystem and community

This multi-vendor approach balances performance requirements, cost optimization, supply chain security, and European sourcing preferences while maintaining technical and commercial flexibility for the embedded vision system development.
