## Cost Driver Analysis

### Major Cost Components
1. **Processing Board**: 30-50% of total cost
   - Ultra-compact options: $50-150
   - High-performance options: $150-400
   
2. **Camera Module**: 15-30% of total cost  
   - Basic USB: $25-50
   - Industrial/MIPI: $80-200
   
3. **Integration Components**: 20-30% of total cost
   - Carrier boards, cables, power management
   - Often underestimated in initial budgets

### Hidden Costs
- **Development Time**: Custom carrier board design
- **Toolchain Costs**: Some SDKs require licensing
- **Certification**: EMC, FCC testing if required
- **Volume Considerations**: Prototype vs. production pricing

## European Sourcing Analysis

### Preferred European Suppliers
| Supplier | Product Categories | Shipping | Lead Time | Payment Terms |
|----------|-------------------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Farnell UK** | Passives, power, mechanical | Same-day available | 1-2 days | Net 30 |
| **RS Components** | Industrial components | Next-day available | 1-3 days | Credit account |
| **EBV Elektronik** | Arducam products | Standard shipping | 3-5 days | Varies |
| **The Pi Hut** | Raspberry Pi ecosystem | UK shipping | 2-3 days | PayPal/Card |

### Direct Manufacturer Sourcing
- **e-con Systems**: Direct sales to EU, 2-3 week lead time
- **Portwell**: Requires distributor contact, TBD lead times
- **ELP**: Ships from China, 1-2 weeks, customs duties apply

## Budget Optimization Strategies

### Cost Reduction Options
1. **Relax Size Requirements**: Enable lower-cost, higher-performance options
2. **Reduce Frame Rate**: 30fps vs 60fps can halve camera costs
3. **Standard Interfaces**: USB vs MIPI reduces integration complexity
4. **Development Boards**: Use off-the-shelf vs custom carriers

### Performance Enhancement Within Budget
1. **Software Optimization**: Leverage hardware acceleration efficiently  
2. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Optimize computer vision algorithms
3. **Power Management**: Efficient power design enables smaller form factors

## Risk Assessment - Cost Impact

### High Risk ($50-100 impact)
- Portwell MicroSOM availability and actual pricing
- Custom carrier board development costs
- European import duties and shipping delays

### Medium Risk ($20-50 impact)  
- Component price fluctuations
- Minimum order quantities for some components
- Technical support and development tool costs

### Low Risk ($5-20 impact)
- Standard component availability
- Basic mechanical/electrical components
- Shipping costs for readily available items

## Recommendations

### For $500 Budget Compliance
1. **Choose Configuration A or C** - both meet budget constraints
2. **Verify Portwell pricing** before final commitment to ultra-compact design
3. **Consider Configuration B** with budget increase to $520

### For Optimal Performance/Cost Balance
1. **Recommend Configuration B** with minor budget increase
2. **Standard Jetson ecosystem** provides best long-term support
3. **MIPI interface** offers best performance for embedded vision

### Next Steps
1. **Contact Portwell** for MicroSOM pricing and availability
2. **Request quotes** from European distributors
3. **Prototype testing** with development kits before final selection
