## System Architecture Recommendations

### Data Flow Architecture
```
[Camera Module] → [MIPI CSI-2] → [Processing Board] → [Flight Controller]
     ↓                              ↓
[Image Capture]              [Computer Vision]
[45-80 FPS]                  [Real-time Processing]
```

### Software Stack Recommendation
1. **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu/Yocto) with real-time kernel
2. **Computer Vision**: OpenCV with hardware acceleration
3. **Communication**: MAVLink protocol for flight controller interface
4. **Development**: Cross-compilation toolchain and remote debugging

### Integration Guidelines

**Mechanical Integration:**
- Design custom PCB carrier for space optimization
- Implement vibration dampening for camera module
- Consider thermal management for processing board
- Plan cable routing for minimal interference

**Electrical Integration:**
- Single power input (12V from flight controller typical)
- Power sequencing for proper startup
- EMI shielding for radio frequency compliance  
- Connector selection for reliability in flight environment

## Supplier and Procurement Strategy

### Primary European Suppliers
1. **NVIDIA Jetson Products**: RS Components, Arrow Electronics
2. **Camera Modules**: e-con Systems direct, EBV Elektronik for alternatives
3. **Integration Components**: Farnell, RS Components
4. **Custom PCB**: European PCB manufacturers (PCBWay EU, Eurocircuits)

### Procurement Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Component selection confirmation and quote requests
- **Week 3-4**: Purchase orders and component procurement
- **Week 5-8**: Custom carrier board design and manufacturing
- **Week 9-12**: System integration and testing
- **Week 13-16**: Final validation and documentation

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance Shortfall**: 
   - Mitigation: Prototype testing with development kits first
   - Fallback: Algorithm optimization and reduced processing requirements

2. **Size Integration Challenges**:
   - Mitigation: 3D modeling and mechanical prototyping early
   - Fallback: Relaxed size requirements if performance critical

3. **Power Consumption**:
   - Mitigation: Power measurement during prototyping
   - Fallback: Larger battery capacity or power optimization

### Supply Chain Risks  
1. **Component Availability**:
   - Mitigation: Alternative component identification
   - Fallback: Extended delivery timeline acceptance

2. **Pricing Fluctuations**:
   - Mitigation: Budget contingency of 15-20%
   - Fallback: Component substitution or requirement relaxation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (4 weeks)
- Procure development kits (Jetson Nano + camera)
- Develop basic computer vision algorithms
- Validate performance requirements
- Test flight controller communication

### Phase 2: Integration Design (6 weeks)  
- Design custom carrier PCB
- Mechanical integration planning
